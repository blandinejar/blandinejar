### Hi there! 👋

My name is Blandine Jarysta. I live near Lille, France, and I recently finished a 6-month JavaScript-centric course at École O'clock. I'm currently in an apprenticeship with the same school, working at Squadeasy in Paris.

I'm a junior developer and I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, React and Redux. I strive to improve my skills and am constantly willing to learn new things! 😍

You can view my portfolio [here](https://blandinejarysta.netlify.app/). 😊 (*For now, it's only available in French, but I would like to make it available in English in the near future.*)

Before switching career paths to study web development, I was an English to French translator and proofreader for a brief period of time. 

### Miscellaneous

In my spare time, I like going to the theatre 🎭, reading 📚, training at the gym 🏃‍♀️, watching films and TV shows 📺, drawing (traditionally and more recently, digitally) ✏️, and caring for my plants 🌱.
