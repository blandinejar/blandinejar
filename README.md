### Hi there! 👋

My name is Blandine Jarysta, and I live near Lille, France. After finishing a 6-month JavaScript-centric course at École O'clock in September 2021, I followed an 18-month apprenticeship with the same school, whilst working at Squadeasy in Paris. Our stack was the following: JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, Jest, Cucumber, and a little bit of AWS.

In March 2023, I started working at Inetum. I first was part of a project for Auchan Retail France during 3 and a half months, during which I developed a program to convert XML files into Protobuf and used several tools in GCP (Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery).

In July 2023, I started working for Kiloutou as a back-end developer. I use TypeScript, NodeJS, Jest, AWS (mostly Lambda and S3), Terraform.

Through my past and current experiences, I have taken part in a lot of agile practices and got interested in craftsmanship. I strive to improve my skills and am constantly willing to learn new things! 😍

Before switching career paths to study web development, I was an English to French translator and proofreader for a brief period of time. 

### Miscellaneous

In my spare time, I like going to the theatre 🎭, reading 📚, running outside and training at the gym 🏃‍♀️, watching films and TV shows 📺, playing video games 🎮, drawing (traditionally and more recently, digitally) ✏️, and caring for my cat 🐱 and my plants 🌱
